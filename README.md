## Desription 

I was tasked with creating a Quiz game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to test my knowledge of Vanilla JavaScript and Web-API's.

- I was able to build most of the application out but unfortunately ran out of time for this particualr challenge. 

- I swas able to demonstrated my skills with setting a countdown timer.

- I used Objects and Arrays to store question and answer data for the multiple choice questions being asked to the user.

- I was able to use DOM manipulation to show the first set of questions and answers to the user but unfortunately did not have the time to figure out how to show the entire list of questions and answers. 

## Acceptance Criteria 

- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

- WHEN I click the start button

- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

- WHEN I answer a question

- THEN I am presented with another question

- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

- THEN time is subtracted from the clock 

- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

- THEN the game is over

- WHEN the game is over

- THEN I can save my initials and my score
